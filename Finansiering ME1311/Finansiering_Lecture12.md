**Climate risks and market efficiency**
- [[hong et al]] 
- mäter om drought risk index påverker stock prices av food stocks
	- Finding är att drought index forecastar poor profit growth för food companies och poor food stock returns i samma land, av vilket man kan dra slutsatsen att marknaden inte effektivt reagerar på climate change risks

i teori ska goal of firm bestämmas av firms owners
- management/cheif officiers prioriterar ofta employees, customers och environment högt också

Here are some of the most important points in John R. Graham’s _“Presidential Address: Corporate Finance and Reality”_ (2022). I give bullets for clarity; you can tell me if you want deeper explanation of any part.

### Key findings

- He uses large-scale surveys of CFOs (and other corporate finance practitioners) to document what firms _actually do_ on planning, investment, capital-structure, payout and firm objective.

- He compares current behavior to similar survey results from ~20 years ago, to see what has changed and what remains stable. [Harvard Law Forum om Företagsstyrning+1](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/01/21/presidential-address-corporate-finance-and-reality/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- He emphasizes that the “textbook” model (rational managers, optimize, maximize shareholder value, unconstrained capital markets) only partially fits reality. [NBER+1](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Stylised facts/themes about real-world corporate finance

Graham identifies several recurring patterns (or “themes”) in how firms behave:

- **Short horizon for reliable forecasting**: CFOs say their internal forecasts are only reliable for about two years ahead on average. Beyond that, less so. [Harvard Law Forum om Företagsstyrning+1](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/01/21/presidential-address-corporate-finance-and-reality/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Conservative, “sticky”, simple decision‐rules**: Rather than complex optimization, firms tend to use relatively simple heuristics, use rules that have worked, and don’t change often. [NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Market-timing and caution around downside risk**: Managers place heavier emphasis on avoiding bad outcomes than capturing upside surprises. “Downside surprises” get more attention in surveys. [NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Forecasts are mis-calibrated; surprises happen**: Firms expect things to go a certain way, but often face outcomes that deviate—both good and bad. The process of forecasting is uncertain and error‐prone. [NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Shift in firm objectives**: There is increasing emphasis on stakeholders (employees, environment, broader stakeholder groups) and on revenue growth, not only traditional shareholder value. [IDEAS/RePEc+1](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v77y2022i4p1975-2049.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Capital-structure, investment and payout decisions don’t always match academic predictions**: For example, standard explanatory variables for leverage explain only a small fraction of variation (~10 %) and out-of‐sample fit is even worse. [NBER+1](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Implications for theory and research

- Because actual practices differ from idealised models, the research-practice gap remains. Graham argues that academic models need to incorporate the real patterns (e.g., limited forecasting horizon, heuristics, stakeholder objectives) to improve their explanatory power. [IDEAS/RePEc+1](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v77y2022i4p1975-2049.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- He suggests models of **“satisficing”** (rather than full optimization) make sense: because the world is complex and fast changing, managers may aim for “good enough” rather than perfect, and use incremental improvements. [NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- The paper encourages researchers to capture managerial decision-processes (not just outcomes) and to build theory that reflects “finance in practice.”

### Why this matters

- If firms actually operate with short forecast horizons, heuristics, and stakeholder goals, then predictions or prescriptions derived from purely optimizing, long-horizon models may mis‐lead.
    
- Understanding what CFOs _say_ they do helps bridge the gap so academic conclusions are more relevant to real firms.
    
- For practitioners, this research gives empirical backing to the idea that many firms emphasize things like near-term cash flows, conservative decisions, and risk management of downside surprises.

If you like, I can pull out **5-10 specific empirical statistics** or findings from the paper (e.g., percent of firms using a payback rule, forecasting horizon in years, etc.). Would that be useful?

##### Du sade:

what does he say about hurdle rates?

###### ChatGPT sade:

In his 2022 Presidential Address, _“Corporate Finance and Reality”_, John R. Graham highlights that firms typically set investment hurdle rates significantly higher than their weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This practice is consistent across various industries and firm types.

### Key Insights on Hurdle Rates

- **Elevated Hurdle Rates**: Firms often establish hurdle rates that are approximately 6% above their WACC. For instance, if a company's WACC is 9%, the hurdle rate might be set around 15%. [NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Sticky and Conservative**: These hurdle rates exhibit significant inertia, changing only about two or three percentage points over the past 35 years. This stickiness suggests that firms do not adjust their hurdle rates in response to fluctuations in market interest rates, indicating a conservative approach to investment decisions. [NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29841/w29841.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Rationale Behind High Hurdle Rates**:
    
    - **Buffer Against Uncertainty**: By setting higher hurdle rates, firms create a cushion that helps absorb potential negative surprises in project outcomes.
        
    - **Avoidance of Negative Surprises**: This conservative approach aligns with the goal of minimizing the risk of disappointing stakeholders.
        
    - **Simplicity in Decision-Making**: High hurdle rates simplify the decision-making process by providing clear thresholds that projects must exceed to be considered viable.
        
    - **Agency Considerations**: Managers may prefer to avoid the negative implications of failing to meet expectations, leading to more stringent investment criteria.
        
- **Implications for Investment Decisions**: The use of elevated hurdle rates means that firms may reject projects that could be value-accretive under a more traditional evaluation approach. This conservative stance can lead to underinvestment, particularly in environments where the cost of capital is low.
    

In summary, Graham's analysis reveals that firms' capital budgeting practices often deviate from theoretical models, with elevated and sticky hurdle rates serving as tools for risk management and decision-making simplicity.
