Data retrieving

code is trivial, good database design is more important
- infrastructure is most important
- moving/changing databases take a lot of time

data is raw/unprocessed information
data -> information
- when communicated in coherent and meaningful matter

information -> knowledge
- knowledge = information evaluated and organizaed so it can be used purposefully

**types of databases**
- Relational databases
	- changing one piece of data modifies all information that derives from this data is updated accordingly
	- table in relational database is called relation
	- each column is an attribute
	- row is tuple
- Non-Relational
	- ex json files
	- 

Database model
- database has
	- Structures
		- Data structures and tables/relations
		- Database keys
			- Primary key = uniqueness within rows or tables
			- foreign key = primary key from other relation
				- only way join relationships can be established
	- operations
		- Seaches queries, modifications
	- Constraints
		- what data cannot be
		- guidelines on how to use database
		- nontrivial
- all theese need to work togheter
