Chris Argyris, a key figure in organizational theory, introduced **Model I** and **Model II** as two contrasting ways that individuals and organizations approach action, learning, and problem-solving.

Here’s a clear summary:

### **Model I**

Model I is the "default" mental model most people use.  
It is characterized by **defensiveness, control, and limited learning**.

**Governing Values:**

- Achieve your goals as you define them.
    
- Maximize winning and minimize losing.
    
- Minimize negative feelings.
    
- Be rational.
    

**Typical Behaviors:**

- Advocate your own views strongly (without testing them).
    
- Keep control of the task and process.
    
- Avoid openly discussing errors or weaknesses.
    
- Defensive reasoning → blame others, avoid embarrassment.
    
- Leads to **single-loop learning** (fixing problems without questioning underlying assumptions).
    

**Effect in Organizations:**

- Promotes conformity, suppresses dissent.
    
- Limits open communication.
    
- Reduces the organization's ability to adapt and truly learn.

### **Model II**

Model II is the **preferred model** Argyris advocates for.  
It encourages **openness, collaboration, and double-loop learning** (questioning underlying assumptions).

**Governing Values:**

- Valid information: Share data openly, encourage testing of ideas.
    
- Free and informed choice: Everyone can participate in decision-making.
    
- Internal commitment: People take ownership of decisions.
    
- Transparency: Seek to understand and be understood.
    

**Typical Behaviors:**

- Combine advocacy with inquiry (state your view and invite critique).
    
- Surface assumptions and test them with others.
    
- Encourage joint problem-solving and reflection.
    
- Reduce defensiveness, increase trust.
    
- Promotes **double-loop learning** (not just fixing problems, but changing the system that caused them).
    

**Effect in Organizations:**

- Builds trust and collaboration.
    
- Encourages innovation and adaptability.
    
- Creates a learning organization that can evolve over time.
