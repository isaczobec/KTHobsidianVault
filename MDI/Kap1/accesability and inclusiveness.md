Accessibility refers to the extent to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible.

Inclusive design is an overarching approach where designers strive to make their products and services accommodate the widest possible number of people.

designa för accesibility gör inherently inclusive deisgn för alla

Accessibility can be achieved in two ways: first, through the inclusive design of technology, and second, through the design of assistive technology. When designing for accessibility, it is essential to understand the types of impairments that can lead to disability as they come in many forms. They are often classified by the type of impairment, for example: 
- Sensory impairment (such as loss of vision or hearing) 
- Physical impairment (having loss of functions to one or more parts of the body, for example, after a stroke or spinal cord injury) 
- Cognitive (for instance, learning impairment or loss of memory/cognitive function due to old age or a condition such as Alzheimer’s disease)
