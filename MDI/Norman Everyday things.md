Denna om 7 frågor man måste kunna svara på:

- ### Discoverability
- Whenever we engage with an everyday thing such as a TV remote control, or a product like a website or an application, we figure out where and how to perform various functions. Through good discoverability, we can consider the different options and choose the one that should work to meet our goal. However, we cannot do this if the actions are not discoverable.
- Norman describes good discoverability as: “it is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device.” Clear focal points (calls to action, images, and headers); visual hierarchy (content structured in order of priority); and transparent navigation systems all constitute good discoverability and understanding within a design.
- Other design principles, particularly signifiers, feedback, and constraints (we’ll come across these soon), can also increase discoverability and reduce possible errors.
- ### Feedback
- Norman describes feedback as “some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request.” He also explains that feedback must be immediate, informative, discreetly planned, and prioritised.
-  He also explains that feedback must be immediate, informative, discreetly planned, and prioritised.
- Subtle feedback, however, can inform us that our action has worked without interrupting our flow. For example, the Twitter mobile app displays a small, animated message at the bottom of the screen to confirm successfully executed tweets.
- ### Conceptual model
- A conceptual model is a simple and helpful explanation of how something works. For example, a website or application onboarding experience demonstrates how to use the product or service. Norman explains, “the design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to an understanding and a feeling of control.”

- ### Affordance
- Affordance is an object’s perceived action and properties that help us determine its operation. Norman states, “The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person.” For example, door handles and pull chain designs relate to their intended action; hence, form follows function.
- Let’s take a chair, for example; its shape allows sitting. Then some chairs come with casters that afford to push and pull. And, in the extreme case of a fire, we might even perceive the chair’s size and weight as an opportunity to break a window.

- kan vara physical (intrinsic properties) eller percieved (vad usern tror att den kan göra)
- ### Signifiers
- A signifier communicates to us where the action should take place. Norman explains, “The term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behaviour to a person.” For example, a button label tells us precisely what action the corresponding control takes.
- While signifiers clarify where to act, they also rely on cultural understanding. For instance, when Amazon launched its website in India, users mistook the search icon for a ping pong bat. This story proves that signifiers must hold relevant meaning to be recognised by the target user.
- ### Mapping
- Mapping is the relationship between controls and their effect on the world. For example, the arrow buttons on an arcade claw machine correspond to the movements of the toy grabbing mechanical arm. Norman explains, “when mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being controlled, it is easy to determine how to use them.”
- Natural mapping enables us to subconsciously change the effects of our world, such as flicking the appropriate light switches. We can particularly find good mapping behaviours within the iOS control centre, which utilises sliding bars to communicate the effect of our actions.
- Conversely, unnatural mapping increases cognitive and physical effort. For example, an unclear cooker layout makes it difficult to determine which knobs control the corresponding hobs.
- Please note that if a natural mapping is impossible, use signifiers to clarify where the relationships exist.
- ### Constraints
- Long forms, complicated layouts, and heavily written descriptions can increase distraction and cognitive load (working memory).
- Constraints, however, can restrict the kind of interactions that can take place and therefore help reduce the amount of information we process. Norman explains, “physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guide actions and ease interpretation.”
- There are different forms of constraints, including physical, semantic, cultural, and logical. Each can help focus our attention on an important task and help reduce the chance of human error.
- Physical constraints restrict the possible operations; for example, we cannot move a mouse cursor outside the screen. Semantic limitations are clues to where we can perform actions; for instance, a socket has meaning to where we can insert the plug pins. Cultural restrictions are social conventions, such as waiting in a queue to be served. And finally, logical constraints help determine the alternatives; for example, scrolling is how we know how to see the rest of the screen.
### Consistency
**Consistency** – This refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. In particular, a consistent interface is one that follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects. For example, a consistent operation is using the same input action to highlight any graphical object at the interface, such as always clicking the left mouse button. Inconsistent interfaces, on the other hand, allow exceptions to a rule.

### Visibility
The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. Incontrast, when functions are "out of sight," it makes them more difficult to find and know how to use.

## Other Norman things
### Mistakes
- slips: sådant man gör av misstag, man kan egentligen bättre, ex man är tankspridd
- mistakes: när man genuint har missförstått
- slips är när intendar göra rätt, gör fel, mistakes är när intendar göra fel, gör fel
- **Design for errors:**
	- make it possible to make mistakes: gör att konsekvenserna inte blir devestating
	- undo function
	- Ask the user often
	- forcing functions, måste svara ja för fortsätta med något

### 7 stages of action
![[Pasted image 20250122200350.png]]
- model för hur man interagerar med any type of object in soroundings
- först **execution**:
	- måste ha mål att göra något
	- Har intention att göra något för uppnå målet
	- Formulerar sequence of actions som ska göra att man kan uppnå sina actions
	- Utför denna sequence
	- måste pervcieve state av värld
	- Då kan man interpreta om något hände som förde en närmare ens mål
	- evaluera om det förde en närmare sitt mål

#### Feed forward and backward
![[Pasted image 20250122201132.png]]
- ex kulturell information är feedforward - man har elljus överrallt
- feedback - förstå att man gjorde något, att man gjorde rätt eller fel


### Gulf
- ![[Pasted image 20250122201441.png]]
- i alla system där någon når mål genom interagera med system finns differences i understanding
- måste minimera gulf i execution och evaluation bridge
	- gör det lättare att använda, lättare att evaluera om man hade rätt
